# How will you create a dictionary using tuples in python?
"""
--> Initialize two tuples test_tup1 and test_tup2.
--> Print the original tuples using the print() function and str() function to convert them into strings.
--> Check if the length of both tuples is equal using the len() function.
--> If the length of both tuples is equal, use dictionary comprehension to create a dictionary. Here, test_tup1[i] is the key and test_tup2[i] is the value for the ith element of both tuples. The enumerate() function is used to get the index and value of each element of test_tup2.
--> Print the resulting dictionary using the print() function and str() function to convert it into a string.
