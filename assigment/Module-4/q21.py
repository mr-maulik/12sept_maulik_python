# What are oops concepts? Is multiple inheritance supported in java
"""
--> The 4 pillars of OOPs concepts in python are Inheritance, Polymorphism, Encapsulation, and Abstraction.
--> A class is a blueprint, whereas an object is an instance of a class. A class doesn’t occupy any memory, whereas an object occupies space.
--> OOP stands for Object-Oriented Programming, a programming paradigm based on the two main key aspects: “objects” and “classes.”
-->  Polymorphism is an OOPs principle where objects of different classes can be treated as if they belong to the same class. It enables code to be written that can work with various objects, making programs flexible and extensible, and reducing complexity.
--> Inheritance is a principle in OOPs that allows new classes to be based on existing ones, inheriting the attributes and methods of the parent class. It promotes code reusability, saves development time, and enables developers to create more complex and specialized classes.
-->  Encapsulation is a principle in OOPs that combines data and methods within a class to protect the data from external interference. It promotes data security, reduces code complexity, and enables developers to create more modular and maintainable code.
--> Abstraction is a principle in OOPs that allows the implementation details of an object to be hidden from the user, while still providing a simple and easy-to-use interface. It promotes code clarity, reduces complexity, and enables developers to create more scalable and extensible code."""

"""
Multiple Inheritance is the process in which a subclass inherits more than one superclass.

In the below image, we can observe that Class C(sub-class) inherits from more than one superclass i.e., Class A, Class B. This is the concept of Multiple Inheritance.
Many real-world examples of Multiple Inheritance also exist. For example, consider a newly born baby, inheriting eyes from mother, nose from father.

Kindly note that Java does not support Multiple Inheritance, but we can use Interfaces to achieve the same purpose.
